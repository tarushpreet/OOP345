Q3: The workshop opens a file by a fstream is(filename, ios::in); fstream constructor call.  
The program reads the file twice.
The first pass counted the nummber of lines on the file. 
The program allocated a string table of the required size.  
The second pass read the lines into the string table.  
The first pass reads the file until it encountered an EOF (end-of-file) state.  
How do you reset the EOF state so the file can be read in again in the second pass?
  
What function should the program call to reset the error state created when the first pass encounters EOF (end-of-file)?

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to

    design and code a class template

  class KVList {
    K k[N];
    V v[N];
    int count;
  pubic:
  ...
  };

Is it possible to accomplish the same thing as Workshop 4 if you code as a table of KV-pairs?

Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to

    copy data from a file into a sequential container

    reflect on what you have learned in this workshop

Q8: Most algorithms are function templates which wrap a for loop.  
The sort algorthm wraps two for loops. 
Match up the body of the for loops with the function template header

Header 1:
 T accumulate(iterator begin, iterator end, T initialValue)

Header 2:
 T inner_product(iterator begin, iterator end, iterator begin2, T initialValue)

Header 3:
 size_t count count(iterator begin, iterator end, T Value)

Header 4:
 iterator find(iterator begin, iterator end, T Value)

Code Body A:
   T sum = initialvalue;
   for(auto it = begin, it != end, it++)
     sum += *it;
   return sum;

Code Body B:
   T sum = initialvalue;
   for(auto it = begin, it != end, it++)
     sum += *it * *begin2++;
   return sum;

Code Body C:
   size_t hits = 0;
   for(auto it = begin, it != end, it++)
     if(*it == Value)
       hits++;
   return hits;

Code Body D:
   for(auto it = begin, it != end, it++)
     if(*it == Value)
       return it;
   return end;
